# Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System
The main goal of this project Face Recognition Based Attendance System is to take attendance automatically using face recognition. It is a process of recognizing the students face for taking attendance by using face biometrics based on high definition monitor video and other information technology. In this system, a computer will be able to find and recognize human faces fast and precisely in images or videos that are being captured through a surveillance camera. It was completely based on face recognition and face detection. This both detection and recognition will automatically detect the students in the classroom and mark the attendance by recognizing the person. In simple words, it was a computer implementation for recognizing automatically whether the student is present in the classroom or not with the help of still image or video frame.

This project is developed using Python and face detection, face recognition is done with the help of Deep Learning Convolution Neural Network for backend and for frontend PyQT, Django, HTML, CSS is used. Project:: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d9x4MXoiKkxBD9R5-ZdxYDLSiAshTRYX
